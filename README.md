# wordpress-Portfolio

for now, there is not much else to do. The big problem i have is: i donÂ´t have enough content to fill the site. 
What i can do today is: Make a Photo-  gallery Post
after that, i will collect some more Designs and put every single one on a single post. 
I will also include, some shots and a link to my other portfolio page, when that one is ready.
